Our rendition of affinity maturation, which includes competition for antigen (“antibody pong”), death by neglect (a shot of Malört), affinity maturation (a raspberry Chambord cocktail), and DEC-205 (Michel Nussenzweig’s “golden ticket”), won this year’s immunology drink competition!

Special thanks to Chris, who secretly moonlights as a expert mixologist.
