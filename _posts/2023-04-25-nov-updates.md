There are several major lab updates from this past November! First, we congratulate Patrick for being named the Anne E. Dyson Professor of Pediatric Research. 

We also welcome two new bioinformatics analysts, Jordan Chervin and Chloe Troxell. Chloe received her bachelor's degree from Cornell University, and Jordan received her BA from Colgate University and her MS from NYU.

Finally, we wish the best of luck to Senior Bioinformatics Analyst, Lei Li as he moves on to St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.
