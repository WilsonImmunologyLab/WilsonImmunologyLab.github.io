We had a blast building and showing off our own version of a [FACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry#Fluorescence-activated_cell_sorting_.28FACS.29) (Fluorescence-activated cocktail sorting) machine! It runs on a Raspberry Pi and uses a solenoid valve to dispense our drink on-demand.

Congratulations to the [Fu Lab](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/pathology/news/archive/2015/yang-xin-fu-welcome.html) for capturing first place in the Committee on Immunologyâ€™s 2014 drink competition.
