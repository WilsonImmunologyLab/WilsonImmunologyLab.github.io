Postdoc:
  - name: Siri Changrob
    img: ../../img/people/siri.jpeg
    desc: Siri studies the novel influenza vaccine concept based on mosaic influenza proteins to protect against infection from most seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.
  - name: Yanbin Fu
    img: ../../img/people/yanbin.jpeg
    desc: Yanbin is working on design and development of a universal influenza vaccine that could induce broadly neutralizing antibodies directed to the HA stem portion of H3, the more lethal subtype among influenza A subtypes.
  - name: Jenna Guthmiller
    img: ../../img/people/jenna.jpeg
    desc: Jenna studies the features of broadly-neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses and how vaccines can induce them.

  - name: Lei Li
    img: ../../img/people/lei.jpeg
    desc: Recent work focuses on developing novel computational algorithms for single cell multi-modal data processing and applying bioinformatics approaches to the study of B cell biology.

  - name: Jiayi Sun
    img: ../../img/people/jiayi.jpeg
    desc: Jiayi is pairing an antigen baiting approach with single-cell RNA-sequencing to dissect antigen-specific B cell populations in pediatric cohorts infected by influenza viruses.
Students:
  - name: Haley Dugan
    img: ../../img/people/haley.jpeg
    desc: Haley is a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Wilson lab. She is interested in how age and exposure history impact the generation of protective antibody responses to influenza viruses. To do so, she is characterizing monoclonal antibodies induced by natural influenza virus infection and seasonal vaccination in adult and pediatric cohorts.
  - name: Chris Stamper
    img: ../../img/people/chris.jpeg
    desc: Chris is studying some of the mechanisms that underlie affinity maturation, specifically in regards to the targeting of activation-induced cytidine deaminase. By combining computational techniques and modeling with transgenic mice studies, we hope to infer the functional importance and impact of these targeting mechanisms during the humoral immune response against both acute and chronic infections.
  - name: Dustin Shaw
    img: ../../img/people/dustin.jpeg
    desc: Dustin is studying the role of B-cells in the development of the intestinal pathologies associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Specifically, he uses the mAb generation technique to see if B-cells in PSC target any specific antigens.
Group:
  - name: Nai-Ying Zheng
    img: ../../img/people/people.jpeg
    desc: Research technician
  - name: Min Huang
    img: ../../img/people/people.jpeg
    desc: Research technician
  - name: Henry Armando Utset
    img: ../../img/people/henry.jpeg
    desc: Henry is currently working on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-funded universal influenza vaccine project, the aim of which is to develop a novel vaccine that induces a broadly reactive protective response targeted at stable epitopes.
  - name: Jiaolong Wang
    img: ../../img/people/jiaolong.jpeg
    desc: Jiaolong is working on uncovering biological characteristics of broadly-neutralizing antibodies against the influenza virus, and applying these findings in developing a universal influenza vaccine.
  - name: Ebru Ermis
    img: ../../img/people/people.jpeg
    desc: Undergraduate research assistant
  - name: Mia McNair
    img: ../../img/people/mia.jpeg
    desc: Mia is a third-year biology major who is working on characterizing our collection of monoclonal antibodies through the use of techniques such as ELISA.
  - name: Nathan Sattah
