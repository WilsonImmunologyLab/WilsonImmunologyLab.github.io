  - name: Siri Changrob
    img: ../../img/people/Siri_new.jpeg
    desc: Siri is pursuing a specialization in human B cell response to infectious diseases, particularly in the context of human coronaviruses and influenza. Her work aims to understand the diversity of B cells and their antibody responses following natural infection and vaccination, with the ultimate goal of advancing vaccine design by identifying how protective antibodies are formed.
  - name: Yanbin Fu
    img: ../../img/people/yanbin.jpeg
    desc: Yanbin is working on design and development of a universal influenza vaccine that could induce broadly neutralizing antibodies directed to the HA stem portion of H3, the more lethal subtype among influenza A subtypes.
  - name: Jiayi Sun
    img: ../../img/people/jiayi.jpeg
    desc: Jiayi is pairing an antigen baiting approach with single-cell RNA-sequencing to dissect antigen-specific B cell populations in pediatric cohorts infected by influenza viruses.
  - name: Joshua McGrath
    img: ../../img/people/Josh_new.jpg
    desc: Josh is working to engineer novel H3N2 influenza vaccine candidates, and is investigating the relationship between mucosal/systemic B cell responses.
  - name: Atsuhiro Yasuhara
    img: ../../img/people/Atsuhiro.jpg
    desc: Atsu is working to explore antibodies showing cross-reactivity against a broad range of coronaviruses, and develop the universal coronavirus vaccine.

Students:
  - name: Dustin Shaw
    img: ../../img/people/dustin.jpeg
    desc: Dustin is studying the role of B-cells in the development of the intestinal pathologies associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Specifically, he uses the mAb generation technique to see if B-cells in PSC target any specific antigens.
