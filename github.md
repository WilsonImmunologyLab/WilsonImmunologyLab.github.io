Check out the Wilson Labâ€™s [GitHub page](https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab)!

Our GitHub currently features one graphical user interface software for FLU researchers:

[Librator](https://wilsonimmunologylab.github.io/Librator/), a platform for optimized sequence editing, design, and expression of influenza virus proteins.

We also feature two R packages:

[Cookie](https://wilsonimmunologylab.github.io/Cookie/index.html), a method for selecting representative samples from a large population using k-medoids clustering.

[LinQ-View](https://wilsonimmunologylab.github.io/LinQView/), a method that integrates transcritpome and cell surface protein expression for single cell multimodal (CITE-seq, REAP-seq, Total-seq) data.
